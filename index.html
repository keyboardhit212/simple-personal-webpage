            <p>
                My name is Romney Judd Celis but you can just call me <strong>Judd!</strong> and I'm here to introduce myself and get you to know me more! I'm currently taking up a bootcamp training and this is one of our 
                activities. To introduce ourselves using the simple HTML tags that we've discussed so far. So I hope that by this and with this you'd get to know me more.

                For several years ago I decided to take up Information Technology as my college degree just out of curiosity how softwares were made. The days and years were certainly long and the journey was not easy, but I am glad that it was through and the learnings I have acquired were tremendous and extremely helpful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years I have had several opportunities to participate in projects whether in team collaboration or solo. I also have had the chance to meet some amazing people who have contributed directly or indirectly to my growth and skillset, and for that I am deeply grateful and feel indebted in some ways.
